She's sweet and excitable and fiercely loyal and loves animals. She makes banger coffee. The one thing I'd say is a matter of taste that you might not like about her is that she's loud and it's very clear she's from the northeast. Personally, that's something that drew me to her.",

She is  an incredibly hard worker, and always manages to excel at everything she decides to invest her energy into. There is truly no one in the world better to have in your corner than Nadia. 10/10 would recommend. ",
