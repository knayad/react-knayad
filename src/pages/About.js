      <p>
        After learning full stack web development through MIT, I have been
        focusing on front-end design. I also have been dabbling in data science.
        <br />
        I think I'm on life three or four. What do you think?
        <br />
        These days I prefer a quieter energy. I like rock climbing, gardening,
        and coding. Basically, after years in front of people, I like to do
        things where I can interact "at will" rather than as the driving source
        of my bread and butter.
