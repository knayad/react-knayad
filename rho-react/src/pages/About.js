  Hey, my name is Nadia. I'm like a cat in the way that they have nine lives.
  <br />
  I've done a lot of cool things in a lot of industries, but somehow they always
  tie back together. I worked in luxury hospitality, finance-- managing teams
  and clients-- in behavioral therapy, and data to implementation.
  <br />
  After learning full stack web development through MIT, I have been focusing on
  front-end design. I also have been dabbling in data science.
  <br />
  I think I'm on life three or four. What do you think?
  <br />
  These days I prefer a quieter energy. I like rock climbing, gardening, and
  coding. Basically, after years in front of people, I like to do things where I
  can interact "at will" rather than as the driving source of my bread and
  butter.
